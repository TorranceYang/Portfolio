# Portfolio

In this repository are a few hand selected files from work I did on a startup I had with my friends called Nebula Learning. 

*I believe these files to be somewhat representative of my work. However, I did not write 100% of all this code, especially not in functions.js where I only added a few graphing methods.*

## Premise 

The basic premise of the startup was to create a web application on top of which students could access learning modules that would interactively teach them the foundations of statistics and computer science. The most basic version of the website had a lesson featured on the left half of the screen, and a code editor on the right half.

Our first lesson that we fleshed out over the course of this semester gave students the opportunity to manage their own chocolate factory. They'd plant and grow beans, roast them, cook chocolate bars, package them, and then sell them. All of these commands were entered programatically, something like 

 ```javascript
 var cc = new ChocolateCompany();
 cc.plantBeans(0);
 cc.roastBeans();
 ```
 
 ## Our Code
 
The full application utilized MeteorJS. Within it, we built out our front end with React, and had a simple backend powered by Node and MongoDB. It's difficult to describe where all these files were used, but I hope they give out an idea of what me and the team were capable of creating. 

## Notes

I was only allowed to release a few files by the goodwill of the team I worked with! If you'd like to see the entire project, please message me and I can give you temporary read-access to it. You'd also be able to build the project locally and run it.
